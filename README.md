**Task 1**: File Integrity Checker
For this task, I built a tool in Python to monitor changes in files by calculating and comparing their hash values. I chose Python because of its simplicity and powerful libraries like hashlib that can easily generate cryptographic hashes such as SHA-256.

I wrote a script that calculates hash values of files within a folder, saves these hash values as a baseline in a JSON file, and later compares new hash values to detect any unauthorized modifications, added or missing files. The script logs clear messages when changes are detected. This project involved understanding hashing, file handling, and comparing stored data with new data.

To run it, I prompt the user either to create a baseline or to check the integrity of files, making it flexible and user-friendly. This gave me practical experience in cybersecurity principles by automating file tampering detection.
